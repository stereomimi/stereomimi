# Welcome!

- My name's Maria! I'm an italian student, programmer and occasional artist. I'm also interested in linguistics.
- I'm fluent in italian and english, and I can speak portuguese.
- I own a NeoGeo MV1AX board, with a home-made supergun and stereo mod attached.

## Software Info
- I know how to program in C, Rust, Lua, C# and Z80 assembly.
- I have written software ran on bare-metal low-end (by current standards) hardware, such as the NeoGeo's Z80 audio CPU.

## Projects
- **[MZS Neogeo Audio Driver](https://github.com/stereomimi/Mezz-Estate-NeoGeo-Audio-Driver)**: An audio driver for the NeoGeo with FM, SSG, and ADPCM support.
- **[Dream Reporter](https://stereomimi.itch.io/dream-reporter)**: A game prototype made during a 3-day gamejam.
